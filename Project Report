Project Report
The algorithm we created offers a complete meal planning solution. It combines user preferences, available ingredients, and nutritional goals to generate meal plans, shopping lists, and a nutritional analysis. The design focuses on being simple, flexible, and efficient, making it useful for people with different dietary needs and simplifying meal preparation.

Algorithm Design and Components
The algorithm consists of several modular components that ensures functionality and clarity. 

Data Input and Parsing:
Ingredients (CSV): The read_ingredients function parses a CSV file containing ingredient details (name, quantity, unit). CSV was chosen for its simplicity and compatibility with spreadsheets.
User Preferences (JSON/YAML): The read_user_preferences function supports JSON and YAML formats for dietary preferences and nutritional goals. JSON was selected for its widespread use, and YAML provides a human-readable alternative. This dual-format support ensures flexibility, making the algorithm accessible to users with varying technical capabilities.

Recipe Recommendation:
The recommend_recipes function matches user preferences (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, non-vegetarian) and available ingredients against a predefined recipe database. Recipes are recommended only if:
They match the userâ€™s dietary constraints.
All required ingredients are available in sufficient quantities.
This ensures personalized meal options and reduces food waste by prioritizing ingredients already on hand.

Meal Plan Generation:
The create_meal_plan function assigns a recipe to each day of the week from the recommended list. Random selection adds variety while respecting user preferences. This simplifies meal planning and keeps options interesting.

Shopping List Generation:
The generate_shopping_list function identifies ingredient shortages by comparing recipe needs with available stock. Missing ingredients are compiled into a shopping list, making grocery shopping easier and preventing overstocking.

Nutritional Analysis:
The analyze_nutrition function calculates:
Total Weekly Nutrition: Summing nutrients across all planned meals.
Daily Distribution: Nutrients provided by meals on each day.
Goal Comparison: Highlights differences between actual intake and user-defined goals.
This step ensures users are informed about how well their meals align with their nutritional needs, developing healthier eating habits

Visualization:
The visualize_nutrition_data function creates a bar chart comparing actual nutrient intake against user-defined goals. This makes it easier for users to see how well they are meeting their nutritional targets and identify areas for improvement.

Output:
The algorithm saves the meal plan and shopping list to a text file for easy access, allowing users to refer back to their plan conveniently.

Reason for Choosing the Algorithm
Modularity:
Each part of the algorithm handles a specific task. This makes it easy to understand, debug, and update in the future.

Flexibility:
The system supports multiple file formats (CSV, JSON, YAML) and a variety of dietary preferences, making it adaptable to different users.

Efficiency:
Dictionaries are used to store ingredient and recipe data, enabling quick lookups and smooth performance even with large datasets.

User-Centric Design:
Features like personalized recommendations, nutritional analysis, and visualizations prioritize user needs, making the system practical and helpful.

Scalability:
The recipe database can be expanded in future versions, allowing the system to grow and handle more recipes dynamically.

In conclusion, this algorithm was chosen because it combines user preferences, available ingredients, and health goals into one easy-to-use system. Its design focuses on being flexible, efficient, and easy to expand in the future. This makes it a strong solution for meal planning that is both practical and user-friendly.
